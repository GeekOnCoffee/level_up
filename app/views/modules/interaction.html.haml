      %p This section is called Interaction, not User Interface, for a reason. As you'll see in the second part of the Interaction series, there are more interfaces than just the user interface, and building the markup is the simple part. There are entire subdisciplines within UI that deal with human factors that can make the difference between a successful application and a failure.
      %p However, we're still going to start small. This lesson is an introduction to UI building, so that you have the basic building blocks you need for later lessons.

        %h3 Building a Base
        %p The first thing we'll do is use basic markup to build an interface. If you haven't done any work with HTML and UIs before, this may take a bit of time and adjustmnet to learn. Don't worry about making it perfect, though. Focus on getting a solid, basic implementation in place.
